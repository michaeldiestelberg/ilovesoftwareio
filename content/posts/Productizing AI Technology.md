The entire world seems to be in an arms race to productize artificial intelligence. Since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in November 2022, the software industry has been striving to enhance existing products and create entirely new ones based on the technological breakthrough represented by large language models (LLMs). We have come a long way since those humble beginnings, but productization is still in its early stages. I have closely followed software innovation since the 1990s, and this is perhaps the most interesting and fastest competition to productize new technology I have ever witnessed.

The latest AI technology is driving product innovation at an unprecedented pace. Major tech companies dominate the headlines with their efforts to integrate AI into their products. However, smaller companies often take a more creative approach to building new productsâ€”ones that can be immensely useful and may completely change how you approach certain tasks. Interacting with AI also necessitates rethinking user interfaces, leading to innovation in related areas of software development.

I have always been fascinated by the productization of technology. There are countless historical examples of brilliant minds transforming our lives with innovative products that leverage the latest technology.

- Converting heat energy from burning fuel into mechanical work led to the steam engine, which enabled the industrial revolution and transformed transportation (trains, ships).
- Transmitting electrical signals over wires resulted in the invention of the telegraph, a product that revolutionized long-distance communication.
- The internal combustion engine was part of a massive productization effort to build cars, enabling personal transportation and completely changing urban planning and society as a whole.
- Binary logic and electronic circuits facilitated complex calculations and data processing. Productizing these technologies, among many others, led to the personal computer, marking the beginning of the information age.

AI has sparked a massive wave of productization efforts across all industries, mobilizing engineers, designers, product managers, and many other experts to explore useful applications and monetization strategies for this technology. AI itself is not a product; it is the technology that enables new kinds of products. As a product manager, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
